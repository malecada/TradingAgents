# TradingAgents (Crypto-Adapted)

Multi-agent LLM framework for cryptocurrency trading decisions — adapted from the
academic [TradingAgents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138) framework with crypto
data sources, on-chain analytics, ML price forecasting, and Binance Futures
execution. Built as a master's-thesis research codebase.

> **Origin & attribution.** This repository began as a crypto adaptation of
> *TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework* (Xiao, Sun, Luo &
> Wang, 2024) and remains a derivative work under the upstream Apache 2.0 license.
> The framework overview below is inherited from upstream and describes the
> general multi-agent architecture.

## Current research workflow

**Zero strategies are validated.** The active branch is a consolidated audit
correction and research-preparation checkout. Historical positive claims are
subject to later accounting, data and execution corrections.

Start at [docs/RESEARCH_START.md](docs/RESEARCH_START.md) for the current phase,
pinned environment, safe offline verification and evidence routes. Use
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for agent instructions. The [evidence index](docs/research/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md)
identifies superseded claims without deleting original records.

The research objective is positive net returns with little crypto-price exposure
at approximately $1,000 and potentially $10,000. Preparation does not itself
start a strategy experiment, account connection, quote refresh or live trade.

## Framework reference

The following describes the inherited LLM framework and its optional interfaces.
It is retained for attribution and source orientation; it is not the default
entry point for the current quantitative research process.

### TradingAgents Framework

TradingAgents is a multi-agent trading framework that mirrors the dynamics of real-world trading firms. By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents: from fundamental analysts, sentiment experts, and technical analysts, to trader, risk management team, the platform collaboratively evaluates market conditions and informs trading decisions. Moreover, these agents engage in dynamic discussions to pinpoint the optimal strategy.

> TradingAgents framework is designed for research purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

The upstream framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles. This ensures the system achieves a robust, scalable approach to market analysis and decision-making.

### Analyst Team
- Fundamentals Analyst: Evaluates company financials and performance metrics, identifying intrinsic values and potential red flags.
- Sentiment Analyst: Analyzes social media and public sentiment using sentiment scoring algorithms to gauge short-term market mood.
- News Analyst: Monitors global news and macroeconomic indicators, interpreting the impact of events on market conditions.
- Technical Analyst: Utilizes technical indicators (like MACD and RSI) to detect trading patterns and forecast price movements.

</p>

### Researcher Team
- Comprises both bullish and bearish researchers who critically assess the insights provided by the Analyst Team. Through structured debates, they balance potential gains against inherent risks.

</p>

### Trader Agent
- Composes reports from the analysts and researchers to make informed trading decisions. It determines the timing and magnitude of trades based on comprehensive market insights.

</p>

### Risk Management and Portfolio Manager
- Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors. The risk management team evaluates and adjusts trading strategies, providing assessment reports to the Portfolio Manager for final decision.
- The Portfolio Manager approves/rejects the transaction proposal. If approved, the order will be sent to the simulated exchange and executed.

## Optional framework installation and CLI

### Installation

Clone this crypto research derivative:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/malecada/TradingAgents.git
cd TradingAgents
```

For the current pinned research environment, use [the research starting point](docs/RESEARCH_START.md). The following environment and CLI examples describe the optional original framework interface:
```bash
conda create -n tradingagents python=3.13
conda activate tradingagents
```

Install the package and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install .
```

### Docker

Alternatively, run with Docker:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # add your API keys
docker compose run --rm tradingagents
```

For local models with Ollama:
```bash
docker compose --profile ollama run --rm tradingagents-ollama
```

### Required APIs

TradingAgents supports multiple LLM providers. Set the API key for your chosen provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...          # OpenAI (GPT)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...          # Google (Gemini)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...       # Anthropic (Claude)
export XAI_API_KEY=...             # xAI (Grok)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...      # OpenRouter
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=...   # Alpha Vantage
```

For local models, configure Ollama with `llm_provider: "ollama"` in your config.

Alternatively, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### CLI Usage

Launch the interactive CLI:
```bash
tradingagents          # installed command
python -m cli.main     # alternative: run directly from source
```
You will see a screen where you can select your desired tickers, analysis date, LLM provider, research depth, and more.

An interface will appear showing results as they load, letting you track the agent's progress as it runs.

## TradingAgents Package

### Implementation Details

The upstream TradingAgents design uses LangGraph for flexibility and modularity. The framework supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama.

### Python Usage

To use TradingAgents inside your code, you can import the `tradingagents` module and initialize a `TradingAgentsGraph()` object. The `.propagate()` function will return a decision. You can run `main.py`, here's also a quick example:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

You can also adjust the default configuration to set your own choice of LLMs, debate rounds, etc.

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "openai"        # openai, google, anthropic, xai, openrouter, ollama
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.4"     # Model for complex reasoning
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.4-mini" # Model for quick tasks
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

See `tradingagents/default_config.py` for all configuration options.
